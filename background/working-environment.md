# Working Environment

Be careful, but you can carry these exercises out on almost any computer, safely. You may be deleting files and directories, hence the warning! Do not practice on a production system!

If you are familiar with VMWare Workstation or Hyper-V, you can stand up some VMs to carry out this work, this is always the preferred approach.

In Unix, your home directory will be **/home/**_**username**_&#x20;

Throughout these notes, adapt my instructions to wherever your home directory actually is.

Although WSL2 in Windows should be an option, it does load Virtualization components and you may have problems using VMWare Workstation afterwards. At the moment, we only recommend you use a single hypervisor.&#x20;

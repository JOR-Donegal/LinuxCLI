# Deliverables

This document will demonstrate commands at the Linux command prompt. You will be required to keep a list of commands with notes as to why you are using them as well as results of any testing you have done. You may be asked to present these notes as evidence of work completed or as part of a lab book, or a cheat sheet.

When you type commands in Linux, they are save in a history file. If you type the command **history**, it will list the commands you have previously typed, in order. If you type **history > logfile.txt** it will save the current history to a log file. This is a very handy way to records your work.

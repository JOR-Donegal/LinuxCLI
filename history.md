# History

You have probably been using the up and down arrows to scroll through previous commands; this is a great way of making your time at the command prompt more accurate and more efficient.&#x20;

I use the command **history** all the time. It shows me all the previous commands I have used.

When I want to document work I have done on a system, I type

```
history > log.14JUN25
```

This give me a text file of all the commands I have carried out and allows me to document my work.

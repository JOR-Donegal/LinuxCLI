# Copying, Moving and Deleting Files

In either OS, make sure you are in the directory called **CLI**.&#x20;

The format of the copy command is **cp&#x20;**_**source destination**_&#x20;

This will copy from an existing file (_source_) to a new file (_destination_) leaving the original file where it was.&#x20;

To move a file, the command in Unix is **mv&#x20;**_**source destination,**_ this will move an existing file (_source_) to a new location (_destination_) removing the original file&#x20;

To delete a file in Unix, the format of the command is **rm&#x20;**_**filename**_ This will delete a file (_filename_)

# Create a file from the console

There are several ways of creating a plain old text file from the command prompt. We will use a few techniques here primarily for the exercise value!&#x20;

Make sure you are in the directory called CLI. We are going to create a file with the lines (you need to get this exactly right!!):&#x20;

```
Living easy, living free. 
Season ticket on a one-way ride. 
Asking nothing, leave me be. 
Taking everything in my stride.
```

To create a file called _rubbish.txt_ we would type **cat rubbish.txt**&#x20;

You will get a blank line; this is the **cat** command awaiting some input.&#x20;

Type the lines of the sample file with a **\[return]** at the end of each line and then to save the file, press **\<ctrl>\<d>** when you are finished.&#x20;
